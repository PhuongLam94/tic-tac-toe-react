This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I wrote to understand basic about ReactJS.
It uses three component: Square, Board and Game. First it only contains a 3x3 Board, but I extended it to be able to contains any kind of Board.
Rule is simple. Players take turn to fill the squares. If the Board length is less than 5, the number of same squares in a line to win is the Board length. Otherwise, it is 5.
